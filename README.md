## Quickstart

Launch into a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) environment on

| [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest) | [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws) |

## Installation

### Pip Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Clay Foundation Model is via pip:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model.git

This will install the `claymodel` package and all its dependencies. You can then import and use it in your Python code:

```python
from claymodel.datamodule import ClayDataModule
from claymodel.module import ClayMAEModule
```

### Development Installation

For development or advanced usage, you can set up the full development environment:

To help out with development, start by cloning this [repo-url](/../../)

    git clone <repo-url>
    cd model

Then we recommend [using mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)
to install the dependencies. A virtual environment will also be created with Python and
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) installed.

    mamba env create --file environment.yml

> [!NOTE]
> The command above has been tested on Linux devices with CUDA GPUs.

Activate the virtual environment first.

    mamba activate claymodel

Finally, double-check that the libraries have been installed.

    mamba list


## Usage

### Running jupyter lab

    mamba activate claymodel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name claymodel  # to install virtual env properly
    jupyter kernelspec list --json                       # see if kernel is installed
    jupyter lab &


### Running the model

The neural network model can be ran via
[LightningCLI v2](https://pytorch-lightning.medium.com/introducing-lightningcli-v2supercharge-your-training-c070d43c7dd6).

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed via pip, you'll need to clone the repository to access the trainer script and config files.

To check out the different options available, and look at the hyperparameter
configurations, run:

    python trainer.py --help

To quickly test the model on one batch in the validation set:

    python trainer.py fit --model ClayMAEModule --data ClayDataModule --config configs/config.yaml --trainer.fast_dev_run=True

To train the model:

    python trainer.py fit --model ClayMAEModule --data ClayDataModule --config configs/config.yaml

More options can be found using `python trainer.py fit --help`, or at the
[LightningCLI docs](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/2.1.0/cli/lightning_cli.html).

## Contributing

### Writing documentation

Our Documentation uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

Install it with:
```bash
pip install -U jupyter-book
```

Then build it with:
```bash
jupyter-book build docs/
```

You can preview the site locally with:
```bash
python -m http.server --directory _build/html
```

There is a GitHub Action on `./github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` that builds the site and pushes it to GitHub Pages.

## Docker

In order to avoid installing dependencies directly onto the machine, a Dockerized version of the Clay model has been provided. To run it using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) run the following command from the repo root:
```bash
docker-compose up # using the --build flag to force a rebuild, if necessary
```

Alternatively, you can build and run the Docker image using docker directly with:
```bash
docker build . -t claymodel --platform linux/amd64 # build image
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/model -p 8888:8888 -e ENV_NAME=claymodel --platform linux/amd64 claymodel:latest # run container
```

In both cases, the default command will be run, which instantiates a [jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) instance, from which the documentation notebooks can be run. The jupyter notebook will be accssible on the exposed port (`8888`).
### Note: accessing the jupyter-lab instance in the browser requires an authentication token that can be found in the container logs. Look for the following lines:
```bash
model-claymodel-1  |
model-claymodel-1  |     To access the server, open this file in a browser:
model-claymodel-1  |         file:///home/mambauser/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-1-open.html
model-claymodel-1  |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
model-claymodel-1  |         http://3a2045c995b0:8888/lab?token=587bc427e6a84b14bae0f4783567e792cfb3b95e6131f569
model-claymodel-1  |         http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=587bc427e6a84b14bae0f4783567e792cfb3b95e6131f569
```

Additionally the project root will be mounted as volume to the running container so any modifications made to the code base locally will be immediately reflected within the docker container.

### Custom commands:

This default command can be overridden with a custom command:
```bash
docker-compose run claymodel {custom command}
```
or using docker directly:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/model -p 8888:8888 -e ENV_NAME=claymodel --platform linux/amd64 claymodel:latest {custom command}
```

For example, the `bash` command can be used to access an interactive bash session within the running docker container, with the `micromamba` environment already activated:
```bash
# with docker-compose
docker-compose run claymodel bash
(claymodel) mambauser@f04261284e87:/model$
```
```bash
# with straight docker
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/model -p 8888:8888 -e ENV_NAME=claymodel --platform linux/amd64 claymodel:latest bash
(claymodel) mambauser@f04261284e87:/model$
```
