# Clay Foundation Model

## An open source AI model for Earth

Clay is a foundational model of Earth. It uses an expanded visual transformer upgraded to understand geospatial and temporal relations on Earth data. The model is trained as a self-supervised Masked Autoencoder (MAE).

The Clay model can be used in three main ways:
- Generate semantic embeddings for any location and time.
- Fine-tune the model for downstream tasks such as classification, regression, and generative tasks.
- Use the model as a backbone for other models.
