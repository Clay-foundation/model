# Clay Foundation Model

## An open source AI model for Earth

Clay is a foundational model of Earth. It uses a Vision Transformer architecture adapted
to understand geospatial and temporal relations on Earth Observation data. The model is
trained via Self-supervised learning (SSL) using a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) method.

The Clay model can be used in three main ways:
- Generate semantic embeddings for any location and time.
- Fine-tune the model for downstream tasks such as classification, regression, and generative tasks.
- Use the model as a backbone for other models.
