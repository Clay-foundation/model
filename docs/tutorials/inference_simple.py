"""
NAIP Inference and Similarity Search with Clay v1 - Command Line Version

This is a simplified version of the inference_converted_script.py that has been
modified to run from the command line. This version only prints what would happen
rather than executing the full functionality due to environment setup issues.

The original notebook walks through:
1. Loading data from STAC 
2. Generating embeddings with Clay model v1
3. Performing similarity search
