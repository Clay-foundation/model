# Clay Model Documentation

This Documentation uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

Install it with:
```bash
pip install -U jupyter-book
```

Then build it with:
```bash
jupyter-book build docs/
```

You can preview the site locally with:
```bash
python -m http.server --directory _build/html
```

There is a GitHub Action on `./github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` that builds the site and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch.
